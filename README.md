# Electron Reload Typescript

A bare bones Typescript implementation of hot reloading for Electron that uses the much maligned Node.JS `fs.watch`. 

I created this for personal use in a very specific dev environment. It's a public repo primarily so I can link to it in other project's `package.json` and install it with `npm`.

Use at your own risk.
